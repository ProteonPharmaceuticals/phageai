## Framework modules

`lifecycle` - set of methods related with bacteriophage lifecycle research (exploration, prediction);  
`taxonomy` - set of methods related with bacteriophage taxonomy research (TBA);  
`repository` - set of methods related with PhageAI bacteriophage repository (TBA); 

## Usage

We shared numerous examples of using the framework in Jupyter Notebook format (*.ipynb).

## Documentation

The official technical documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs: https://phageai.readthedocs.io

## Installation

_PhageAI_ can be installed by running:

```
pip install phageai
```

It requires Python 3.8.0+ to run. You can also use Conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge phageai
```

#### Install from GitHub

If you can't wait for the latest hotness and want to install from GitHub, use:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/ProteonPharmaceuticals/phageai.git
```

## Community and Contributions

Happy to see you willing to make the PhageAI better. Development on the latest stable version of Python 3+ is preferred. As of this writing it's 3.8. You can use any operating system.

If you're fixing a bug or adding a new feature, add a test with *[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)* and check the code with *[Black](https://github.com/psf/black/)* and *[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)*. Before adding any large feature, first open an issue for us to discuss the idea with the core devs and community.

## Have a question?

Obviously if you have a private question or want to cooperate with us, you can always reach out to us directly by mail.

## Found a bug?

Feel free to add a new issue with a respective title and description on the [the PhageAI repository](https://github.com/ProteonPharmaceuticals/phageai/issues). If you already found a solution to your problem, we would be happy to review your pull request.
